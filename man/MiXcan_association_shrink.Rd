\title{Cell-Type-Aware Association with Shrinkage (Ridge Logistic Regression)}
\usage{
MiXcan_association_shrink(new_outcome, new_y, new_cov = NULL, lambda = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_outcome}{A binary phenotype vector (0/1 or factor).}

\item{new_y}{A matrix or data frame of predicted expression for two cell types (columns = cell_1 and cell_2).}

\item{new_cov}{A data frame of covariates (optional). Can include categorical variables (e.g., country, study).}

\item{lambda}{Optional regularization parameter. If NULL, estimated based on correlation structure.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing effect size estimates, standard errors, and p-values for both cell types,
        and a combined p-value from ACAT.
}
\description{
This function performs cell-type-aware association analysis using ridge-regularized logistic regression
followed by inference using an unpenalized model. It estimates the individual and combined p-values for
predicted gene expressions (e.g., from cell type 1 and cell type 2).
