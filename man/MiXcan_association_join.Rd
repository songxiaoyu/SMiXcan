\title{Cell-Type-Aware Association (Joint Model)}
\usage{
MiXcan_association_join(new_y, new_cov, new_outcome, family = "gaussian")
}
\arguments{
\item{new_y}{A matrix or data frame containing predicted expression levels for two cell types (columns named "cell_1" and "cell_2").}

\item{new_cov}{A data frame of covariates (e.g., age, principal components).}

\item{new_outcome}{A vector or one-column matrix of phenotype values (e.g., binary case/control or continuous trait).}

\item{family}{A GLM family object or string: either \code{"gaussian"} for continuous outcomes or \code{"binomial"} for binary outcomes.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing estimates, standard errors, and p-values for both cell types, as well as the combined p-value using ACAT.
}
\description{
This function fits a generalized linear model (GLM) for joint association testing of two cell-type-specific predicted expressions with phenotype,
adjusting for covariates. It uses ACAT to combine p-values from both predictors.
